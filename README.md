# Scooter-LED-Controller
Full addressable LED controller based on a ESP32. It uses the 12v signals coming from the scooter for indicators, brake lights and light button. **These 12v voltages need to be stepped down to a voltage save for the esp to handle**

# THIS IS STILL IN DEV AND DON'T EXPECT IT TO FUNCTION

example frontend UI:
