# Scooter-LED-Controller
Full addressable LED controller based on a ESP32. in my case it uses the 12v signals coming from the scooter for indicators, brake lights and light button. **These 12v voltages need to be stepped down to a voltage save for the esp to handle (OPTO isolator)**

## THIS IS STILL IN DEV AND HAS A FEW BUGS
